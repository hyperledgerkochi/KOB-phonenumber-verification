# KOB PHONE NUMBER VERIFICATION SERVICE
# ABSTRACT
The KOB Phone Number Verification Service is a part of KochiOrgBook Project.In this project the user is provided with a digital credential that will prove his ownership over his number.The front end of the project is intented to recieve the user's phone number. The service will prove the ownership and sent a digital proof for the same to user. This proof is stored in user's digital wallet.  Further this proof can be used to avail any other service. That is, if the user required to submit his number like to get a license, then this digital credential of number can be given as a proof of his number.
# MOTIVATION
Nowadays phone number became one of the most commonly used identifier.So that our personal number is being one of most shared identity information over Internet and it can be misused as well.While providing number as an identity the service providers will send some OTP to verify our number. So for differrent services we will have to recieve many OTP messages.OTP mechanism is easy and useful but it comes with a few problems such as it is valid till a deadline,wrong entry of OTP requires to generate another one.So a single proof for the given number will be somewhat easier.This will help a person to prove his ownership over the number he provided.
# STATUS
Incubation.
# SOLUTION
This project uses blockchain technology to conduct phone number verification.This will be having a verifiable registry in which verified mobile numbers are stored.Users wiil be provided with a verifiable digital credential for their numbers.Users numbers are verfied using OTP mechanism.Then users recieve a digital proof for their numbers.This proof provided to user helps to avoid publicly presenting personal numbers as identifiers which can be possibly a threat.User can submit this digital proof of ownership of the phone number when he provides his phone number for availing any third-party services.For instance if we encounter a field in an online form to enter mobile number, instead of giving number we can give this proof. The service provider will use  a consent mechanism. Consent mechanism means the service provider seeking consent from user and then reaching the number via the proof.
