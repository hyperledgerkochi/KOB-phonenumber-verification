# SOLUTION
This project uses blockchain technology to conduct phone number verification.This will be having a verifiable registry in which verified mobile numbers are stored.Users wiil be provided with a verifiable digital credential for their numbers.Users numbers are verfied using OTP mechanism.Then users recieve a digital proof for their numbers.This proof provided to user helps to avoid publicly presenting personal numbers as identifiers which can be possibly a threat.User can submit this digital proof of ownership of the phone number when he provides his phone number for availing any third-party services.For instance if we encounter a field in an online form to enter mobile number, instead of giving number we can give this proof. The service provider will use  a consent mechanism. Consent mechanism means the service provider seeking consent from user and then reaching the number via the proof.
