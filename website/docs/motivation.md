Nowadays phone number became one of the most commonly used identifier.So that our personal number is being one of most shared identity information over Internet and it can be misused as well.While providing number as an identity the service providers will send some OTP to verify our number. So for differrent services we will have to recieve many OTP messages.OTP mechanism is easy and useful but it comes with a few problems such as it is valid till a deadline,wrong entry of OTP requires to generate another one.So a single proof for the given number will be somewhat easier.This will help a person to prove his ownership over the number he provided.
